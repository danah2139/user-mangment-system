# User Management System

## Description

The User Management System is a RESTful API built with Node.js and TypeScript, designed for managing user registration, authentication, and CRUD operations on user data. This project employs best practices for modular design, security, and performance.

## Endpoints

### Authentication

- **Register a new user**
  - **URL**: `/api/auth/register`
  - **Method**: `POST`
  - **Body**: `{ "name": "string", "email": "string", "password": "string" }`
  - **Response**: `201 Created`
  - **Description**: Registers a new user.

- **Login a user**
  - **URL**: `/api/auth/login`
  - **Method**: `POST`
  - **Body**: `{ "email": "string", "password": "string" }`
  - **Response**: `200 OK`
  - **Description**: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.

### User Management

- **Get all users**
  - **URL**: `/api/users`
  - **Method**: `GET`
  - **Headers**: `{ "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }`
  - **Response**: `200 OK`
  - **Description**: Retrieves a list of all users.

- **Update a user**
  - **URL**: `/api/users/:id`
  - **Method**: `PUT`
  - **Headers**: `{ "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }`
  - **Body**: `{ "name": "string", "email": "string" }`
  - **Response**: `200 OK`
  - **Description**: Updates the details of a user by ID.

- **Delete a user**
  - **URL**: `/api/users/:id`
  - **Method**: `DELETE`
  - **Headers**: `{ "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }`
  - **Response**: `200 OK`
  - **Description**: Deletes a user by ID.

## High Availability and Performance

### Scaling the Service

To handle increased load and ensure high availability, the service can be designed with horizontal scaling in mind. This involves deploying multiple instances of the application across different servers or containers, managed by an orchestration tool such as Kubernetes.

### Using AWS for High Availability

- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers, etc.) to ensure no single instance becomes a bottleneck.
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to traffic patterns. This ensures that the application can handle spikes in traffic while optimizing costs during low-traffic periods.
- **RDS Multi-AZ Deployment**: Uses Amazon RDS to set up a relational database in multiple availability zones, providing high availability and failover support.

### Caching and Load Balancing

- **Amazon ElastiCache**: Implements caching for frequently accessed data using Redis or Memcached, reducing the load on the database and improving response times.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Uses Amazon CloudFront to distribute static and dynamic content to users with low latency by caching copies of content at edge locations globally.

## Security and Data Protection

### Security Measures

- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS/TLS to encrypt data in transit and ensure secure communication between clients and the server. Encrypt sensitive data at rest using services like AWS KMS.
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration data such as database credentials and API keys in environment variables, managed securely using AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

### User Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. Tokens are generated upon successful login and must be included in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles and permissions.

### Compliance with Data Protection Regulations

- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure that the service complies with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by providing mechanisms for users to access, update, and delete their data. Implement data anonymization and pseudonymization where necessary.
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain audit logs for critical actions such as data access and modifications to ensure accountability and traceability.

### Secure Data Storage and Transmission

- **AWS S3**: Use Amazon S3 for secure and scalable storage of user data, with bucket policies and IAM roles to control access.
- **AWS IAM**: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define fine-grained access policies for different components of the service, ensuring that only authorized entities can access sensitive data.
